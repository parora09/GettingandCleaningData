# GettingandCleaningData
# lets check the zip file and the new folder that has been unzipped
#define the path where the new folder has been unziped
#create a file which has the 28 file names
#show the files
#begin how to create the data set of training and test
#Reading training tables - xtrain / ytrain, subject train
#Reading the testing tables
#Read the features data
#Read activity labels data
#Create Sanity and Column Values to the Train Data
#Create Sanity and column values to the test data
#Create sanity check for the activity labels value
#Merging the train and test data - important outcome of the project
#Create the main data table merging both table tables - this is the outcome of 1
#read all the values that are available
#Need to get a subset of all the mean and standards and the correspondongin activityID and subjectID 
#A subtset has to be created to get the required dataset
# New tidy set has to be created 
#The last step is to write the ouput to a text file
