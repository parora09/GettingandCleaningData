Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0 By Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.

Description: The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (walking, walkingupstairs, walkingdownstairs, sitting, standing, laying) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually.

A thorough description of the complete dataset comes with the data which can be downloaded as described in run_analysis.R.

The complete dataset was merged, cleaned and only a subset was selected to create the dataset tidydataframe.txt. The processing script to achieve this can be found in run_analysis.R All necessary steps are described there.

A complete list of the remaining variables and their description can be found in the codebook.
